<p> Conditional statement is common across many programming languages. Although the syntax varies from language to language, the basic structure (in pseudocode form) looks like this:</p>

<pre>

    If (boolean condition) Then
        (consequent)
    Else
        (alternative)
    End If
    
    - JavaScript
    
    
    if (password ==== "******") {
      console.log("Wellcome to .....!");
    } else {
      console.log("WRONG Password!");
    }
    
   Notes:  boolean condition returns a true or false value
           if true then do .....
           if (boolean condition) is not true ,then check  ...
           it starts from the top looking for expressions that evaluate to true.
           
       
       a=1
       b=9
       
       if (b > a ){
         console.log("b is greater than a .....!");
       }else{
            console.log("b is greater than a .....!");       
       }
         - Substitute b with 9 and a with 1
         - 9 > 1 yes means true
         - if the condition(9 > 1) is true then 
         - without looking and else{.....} 
           
           
           
  </pre>

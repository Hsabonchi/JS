<p> Conditional statement is common across many programming languages. Although the syntax varies from language to language, the basic structure (in pseudocode form) looks like this:</p>

<pre>

    If (boolean condition) Then
        (consequent)
    Else
        (alternative)
    End If
    
    - JavaScript
    
    
    if (x="Heads") {
      console.log("You got Heads!");
    } else {
      console.log("You got Tails!");
    }
    
   Notes:  boolean condition returns a true or false value
           if true then do .....
           if (boolean condition) is not true ,then check  ...
           it starts from the top looking for expressions that evaluate to true.
  </pre>

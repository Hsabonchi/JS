            An answer: The mathematical variable
            
            
 #### Declarations have the form
         
    var <variableName> = <expression>
    
    <expression> can be:
    
    2 ,  2+3  , 2 > 3

   Example:
    
    var hasan=7  // It bounds the variable name hasan (variable name could be anything) to a value (3).
    
    a variable can be modified or changed later.
    
    var hasan=10 // now the value is 10 instead of 7

            What is the single most important mathematical
            concept ever developed in human history?  -- Credit to COS 326 Princeton University

            An answer: The mathematical variable
            
            
 #### Declarations have the form
         
    var <variableName> = <expression>
    
    <expression> can be:
    
    2 ,  2+3  , 2 > 3

   Example:
    
    var hasan=7  // It bounds the variable name hasan (variable name could be anything) to a value (3).
    
    a variable can be modified or changed later.
    
    var hasan=10 // now the value is 10 instead of 7
    
    
   *** you can rename hasan to zzz by replacing the definition and all its uses with the new name.
   *** a variable has a scope;
   *** By convention to captialize the second part of the variable name. e.g  var myLastname="xxxxx"

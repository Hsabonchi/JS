#### LOOP

A loop in a computer program is an instruction that repeats until a specified condition is reached. In a loop structure, the loop asks a question. If the answer requires action, it is executed. The same question is asked again and again until no further action is required. Each time the question is asked is called an iteration. 

A "For" Loop is used to repeat a specific block of code a known number of times. For example, if we want to check the grade of every student in the class, we loop from 1 to that number. When the number of times is not known before hand, we use a "While" loop.

<pre>
  // design pattern 
 for (var i=start_value; i < finish_value; i = i + by_count ) 
   {         
       do something 
   }
     

####### Variables: 
         i      : the loop index ,Changes from start to finish. 
         start  : usually one 
         finish :  ( found with length(array) )

            What is the single most important mathematical
            concept ever developed in human history?  -- Credit to COS 326 Princeton University

            An answer: The mathematical variable


##### From computer scientis perspective.

            Variable A variable is a name given to the memory cell or cells that can hold the representation of
            a value of a specific type. The value may be changed during the execution of the program.

            
 #### Declarations have the form
         
    var <variableName> = <expression>
    
    <expression> can be:
    
    2 ,  2+3  , 2 > 3

   Example:
    
    var hasan=7  // It bounds the variable name hasan (variable name could be anything) to a value (3).
    
    a variable can be modified or changed later.
    
    var hasan=10 // now the value is 10 instead of 7.
    
    var x = 3+4   // first evalutes the expression (3+4) then bind it to x .
    
    
    
    
   <pre> 
   *** you can rename hasan to zzz by replacing the definition and all its uses with the new name.
   *** a variable has a scope;
   *** By convention to captialize the second part of the variable name. e.g  var myLastname="xxxxx"
   *** Every variable binding has a scope, which is the portion of the code that can refer to that binding.
   
   </pre>  
   
   <pre>
     var x=1
     var  y
    
     y=x
   
     what x=y means?
     Can be read from right side of the equal sign to left. 
     set the value of x to be equal to the value of y
     
     Please note that '==' double equal sign is differnt than '=' single.

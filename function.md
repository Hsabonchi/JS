  ##### Why we need to use/learn function?
 

  - A key principle to consider when developing your applications is to not repeat code unnecessarily. 
     This is commonly known as the DRY principle: Don't Repeat Yourself.(reusability)
  
  
  #### Functions
  
    <p> Functions are reusable blocks of code that have a name, may take in arguments, perform some 
    operations on those arguments, and may return a new value. Breaking complex tasks into smaller, 
    clearly labelled functions will also make them easier to read
    and comprehend. Functions can be thought of as building blocks for a program. </p>

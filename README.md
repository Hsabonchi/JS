# JavaScript

 <pre>
    ▶ JavaScript is a`Dynamically typed languages`means you do not have to specify types every time.
      Dynamically-typed languages perform type checking at runtime,determines its variables' data types based 
      on their values e.g a=1.In Javascript,we do'nt use <strike>int a=1 </strike>
      
    ▶ JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
    
     <strong> Basic types </strong>
     
     
     Six Data Types that are primitives, checked by typeof operator:
      ▶ undefined : typeof instance === "undefined"
      ▶ Boolean : typeof instance === "boolean"
         ▶ Boolean: logical values, that is, either True of False. 0 or 1.
         ▶ Usual operations like && (and), || (or) and not return a boolean value.
         ▶ Result of comparisons with ==, /=, <  also return a boolean value. 
         E.g
         > 1 == 2 || 3 == 4
         False
         > 1 < 2 && 3 < 4
         True
         
      ▶ Number : typeof instance === "number"
      ▶ String : typeof instance === "string"
      
      
      
     Iteration = repeating a process a number of times

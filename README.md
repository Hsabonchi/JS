### JavaScript

<pre>
     `Programming is like riding a bicycle: it
     looks easy when someone else is doing it, may seem
     impossible when you first try to do it yourself, but becomes simple and natural with practice.
  – From ”Programming in Haskell”`

 <pre>
    ▶ JavaScript is a`Dynamically typed languages`means you do not have to specify types every time.
      Dynamically-typed languages perform type checking at runtime,determines its variables' data types based 
      on their values e.g a=1.In Javascript,we do'nt use <strike>int a=1 </strike>
      
    ▶ JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
    
    
     <strong> Basic types </strong>
     
     Expressions are computations 
         – 2 + 3 is a computation.
         
     Values(a subset of the expressions) are the results of computations
          – 5 is a value
          
      Types describe collections of values and the computations that generate those values
          –int is a type
     
     <h4> Six Data Types that are primitives, checked by typeof operator: </h4>
     
      ▶ undefined : 
      
      ▶ Boolean : 
         ▶ Boolean: logical values, that is, either True of False. 0 or 1.
         ▶ Usual operations like && (and), || (or) and not return a boolean value.
         ▶ Result of comparisons with ==, /=, < and >  also return a boolean value. 
         
         E.g
         > 1 == 2 || 3 == 4 return False .
         
         > 1 < 2 && 3 < 4   return True.
         
      ▶ Number : typeof 3 === "number"
      
      ▶ String : typeof "JavaScript" === "string"
          
        ▶ a sequence of characters e.g 'javascript'
        ▶ Can be written in double quotes: "hello" OR in single quotes: 'hello'.
        
      
         Iteration = repeating a process a number of times.

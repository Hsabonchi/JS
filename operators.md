  Operators = < <= > >= <> which compare two values and evaluate to either true or false
  
  There are three logical operators: && (and), || (or), and not (exactly as it looks). The semantics
  (meaning) of these operators is similar to their meaning in English. For example, x > 0 && x <
  10 is true only if x is greater than 0 and less than 10.

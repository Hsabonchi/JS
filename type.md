What is a type?
     A type is  a name for a collection of related values.
     

 Basic Types 
     
     
     Six Data Types that are primitives, checked by `typeof` operator:
      ▶ undefined : typeof instance === "undefined"
      ▶ Boolean : typeof instance === "boolean"
         ▶ Boolean:contains the two logical values, that is, either True of False. 0 or 1.
         ▶ Usual operations like && (and), || (or) and not return a boolean value.
         ▶ Result of comparisons with ==, /=, <  also return a boolean value. 
         E.g
              > 1 == 2 || 3 == 4
              False
              > 1 < 2 && 3 < 4
              True
         
      ▶ Number : typeof 4 === "number"
      ▶ String : typeof instance === "string"
        ▶ a sequence of characters e.g 'javascript'
        ▶ Written in double quotes: "hello".
        ▶ Written in single quotes: 'hello'.
        
      
     Iteration = repeating a process a number of times

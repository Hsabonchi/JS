- String concatination means paste two or more string together

     "Hello" + "World" the result will be one word  as  ---->   "Hello World"

      You cannot perform mathematical operations on strings, even if the strings look like numbers, so the
      following are illegal:
    
       "2"-"1"
   




• Write a function that takes in a name as a argument and return the Hello {name}.

  e.g  WellcomeFunc("JavaSCript") ----> "Hello JavaSCript"

• write a function that takes a String, and returns whether or not that String is more than 10 characters long. 
 e.g "hello" --> false;

• Create a string with your first name
  var first_name = "Put your name here"
  
• Use a string operator (+) on the string from above to create 
    a string that contains both your first and last names.
    var fullName= ...............
